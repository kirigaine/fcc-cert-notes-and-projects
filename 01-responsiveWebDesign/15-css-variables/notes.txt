css variables are noted using --variable-name: value;

to use said variable, put var in front of them like var(--variable-name)

you can add another parameter to var() call as a fallback
e.g. var(green, blue)

if green fails to work, blue is used

:root{} is highest selector in CSS
usually variables are put in it because of scope issues

gradients in css are a transition between colors across distance of element. applied to background property
syntax:
gradient-type(
	color1,
	color2
);

gradients can have 20% after each parameter to determine when that color ends

repeating-linear-gradient is another type that will continue until end of element

if an element has zero size and borders, they come together into the middle. can use 
this trick to make triangles

gradient type also takes an optional direction as a first parameter in degrees

you can use two gradients separated by commas, it fills in behind last added gradient

radial-gradient exists, instead of direction accepts location of circle
e.g. `circle closest-corner at 15% 15%`
