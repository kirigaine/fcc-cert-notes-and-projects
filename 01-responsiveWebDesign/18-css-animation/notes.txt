using an absolute position and a border radius, we can make a wheel from a border

don't forget you can set position values with absolute to percentages

a transform-origin property tells the point css transformations are applied around.

we use 0% 0% to set the topleft

@keyframes at-rule defines flow of css animation. you create selectors for specific points in animation sequence. can either be percentages or use from and to to define the start and end

they require a name assignment to be referenced. e.g. @keyframes wheel{}

the animation-name cssproperty is used to link @keyframes to a css selector
animation-duration cssproperty is used to set how long it should take
animation-iteration-count cssproperty sets how many times animation should repeat - infinite is an acceptable value
animation-timing-function cssproperty sets how it progresses. use linear so its constant

we can use just the animation property to set all these at once

ease-in-out timing function makes it faster in middle but slower at ends

keyframes can control more than just transformation

we use colors in the example
