define variables using let:
```let character = "Hello";```

JavaScript has seven primitive data types, String is one of them.
String denoted by ' or ". Strings are immutable.

console.log(); to print to console

Do not need to define variable again to alter

JavaScript uses camelCase

uninitialized variables have undefined value

with numeric variable you can do math

let rows = [];

Arrays are mutable
use array length to access last

Methods are functions associated with values or objects

push() returns the new length of array

const are constants that cannot be reassigned

for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
  console.log(i);
}

for (const row of rows) {
  result = result + row;
}

string.repeat() will make it repeat however many times

functions with no return return undefined

JavaScript has a defined list of falsy values. Some of them include false, 0, "", null, undefined, and NaN

while (condition) {
  logic;
}

== is equality but can be true for "0" == 0, where if you want value and type, use strict equality ===

The strict inequality operator !== allows you to check if two values are not equal, or do not have the same type

.unshift() method of arrays pushes to beginning
.shift() method removes first element of array instead of end
