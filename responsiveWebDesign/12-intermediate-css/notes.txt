box-sizing: border-box ensures elements include padding and border in their
specified width and height

default positioning for all elements is static.
you wont be able to move it with top, bottom, left or right if assigned

relative is positioned according to normal flow of document but values become active

absolute position takes it out of normal document flow and determines its position by top, left, etc modifiers

fixed lets an element fix to the page no matter where scrolling

sticky is a hybrid of relative and fixed. element sticks to specific position in containing element based on scroll position

quick tip: set all positions to absolute and 0, then margin auto to center verticall and horizontally
