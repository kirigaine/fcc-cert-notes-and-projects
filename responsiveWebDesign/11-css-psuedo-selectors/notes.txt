`aria-hidden="true"` is property to hide element from screen reader

Screen readers flow through HTML document, but don't always make sense.
So we can use CSS selectors to reverse html on screen and maintain logic
of order

`<span>` elements The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document

Can use CSS to combine 3 table elements into one to help screen reader but maintain logic
of order.

`<caption>` element is first child of `<table>`, describes what table is about
can be positioned with `"caption-side"` property

`<thead>` & `<tbody>` to distinguish head from content
`<tr>` for table row
`<td>` for data cell
`<th>` for header cell
