strings have a .match() method and accepts regular expressions

.test returns a boolean instead

arrays have .some() method where it tests every element of an array vs a function and gives boolean

regex characte classes are contained within brackets, defines range of characters

capture groups are defined by parentehesis. part of the expression to capture and save for later reference

? 0-1 matches
+ 1or more matches

we dont need the match, so we can turn it into a noncaptured capturing group by putting ?: after first parentheses

check for spaces before and after pattern using \s to match spaces, tabs and line breaks

^ asserts pattern match starts at beginning of full string

$ asserts end of pattern match:wq
