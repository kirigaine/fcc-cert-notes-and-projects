keydown events fire every time a user pressers a key on their keyboard, a good way to provide
interactivity to input elements

whenever an event listener is triggered by an event, an event object is created.
you don't always need to use this object

numberInput.addEventListener("keydown", (e) => {
  if (e.key === "Enter") {}
});

while input type="number" element restricts by only allowing numbers and making validation easier, values from HTML elements come as strings. Also can be changed when submitting. Also empty inputs are string ""
