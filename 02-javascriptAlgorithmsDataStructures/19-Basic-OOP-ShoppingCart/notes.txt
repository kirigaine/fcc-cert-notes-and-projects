JS also has a cLass. classes are blueprints for creating objects. Allows you to instantiate a defined classes with a set of properties and methods

class Computer{
	constructor(){
		this.ram=16;

};

constructors are called when created, where you initialize properties

class Computer {
  constructor() {
    this.ram = 16;
  }

  addRam(amount) {
    this.ram += amount;
  }
}


instantiate by const myComputer = new Computer();
