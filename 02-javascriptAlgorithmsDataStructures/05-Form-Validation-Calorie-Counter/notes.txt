setting a button type to button can prevent automatic submitting

to access an element by id, youcan use getElementById() method

is or has are often prefixes for booleans

values from html elements come as strings

regex are patterns for strings that return boolean. /hello/ matches literal "hello"

you have to escape +
\s matches whitespace

must wrap in brackets to look for each character individually, dont need to escape then

there are specific flags to alter pattern matching behavior. g flag stands for global and looks after finding a match

javascript has a .replace() method to alter string with another

numper inputs in HTML allow exponential notation (1e10). need to account for

i flag is insensitive to casing
+ modifier matches patterrn one or more times
shorthand character class to match numbers is \d instead of [0-9]

.match() method returns array of match results to regex, either the first or all if global flag used

match has the following format: [ '1e3', index: 0, input: '1e3', groups: undefined ]


    "1e3" is the matched value against the /\d+e\d+/i regex.
    index: 0 is the index of the matched value in the string.
    input: '1e3' is the original string that was matched.
    groups: undefined are the matched groups, which are not used in this case. 


match returns null when nothing found

JS has template literals, to interpolate variables directly into a string. Denoted using backticks

To get all of number inputs, can use querySelectorAll() method
Returns a NodeList

to see new HTML content, ned to use innerHTML to set or return html content inside element

We've set button behavior using onclick property. Can also add event listeners.

```const button = document.querySelector('.btn');
function printName() {
  console.log("Jessica");
}
button.addEventListener('click', printName);
```

pass the variable function reference, not call the function

Updating innerHTML directly doesnt preserve input content. Use insertAdjacentHTML() method instead

First argument it takes is string that specifies position of inserted element.
Second is HTML to be inserted

"beforeend" inserts as last child of element
can iterate through list using for... of

for (const item of list){
}

In JavaScript, values can either be truthy or falsy. A value is truthy if it evaluates to true when converted to a Boolean. A value is falsy if it evaluates to false when converted to a Boolean. null is an example of a falsy value.

browsers have popup alert() function to make a popup 

to convert string to a number, use Number constructor
Number('10');

e is common name for a browser event parameter

Default action of submit event is to reload the page. this can be done using preventDefault() method of e parameter

toLowerCase() method works for string

Math.abs() returns absolute value

HTML elements have a classList property that has a .remove() method which lets us remove a class from the element

Array object has a .from()  object that takes array-like objects (such as a NodeList) and turns it into an array. Generally used to access more robust array methods

innerText will not render HTML elements, instead showing rawtext as compared to innerHTML

opposite of the .remove function of classList earlier, there is .add to add classes to an element
