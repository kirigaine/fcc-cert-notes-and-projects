Fetch API is built in JS interface to make network requests to a server

fetch() handles GET, POST, PUT, PATCH requests

fetch("https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/news-author-page/authors.json")

a fetch() method returns a Promise, which is a placeholder object that is either fulfilled if successful or rejected if unsuccessful

If fulfilled, it resolves to a Response object, and we can use .then() to access it

Data from GET is not usable. TO make usable, just .json() on response object to parse it into JSON.

To work with the data after that, use another .then

fetch('https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/news-author-page/authors.json')
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
  })


.catch() is used to handle rejected promises

fetch('https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/news-author-page/authors.json')
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);   
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error(`There was an error: ${err}`);
  });
