All modern browsers support Web Audio API, which lets you generate and process audio in web apps

new Audio() creates HTML audio element

Spread operator (...) allows you to copy all elements from one array to another
Can also be used to concatenate multiple arrays

Arrow functions are anonymous function expression and a shorter way to make functions

they have no name. to assign name, assign function to a variable

arrow functions can take parameters, for example

const greet = (name) => {
console.log(`Hello ,${name}!`);
};

You can omit the parentheses if only one parameter
If your arrow function is returning a simple expression, you dont need to explicitly state return or use curly braces. This is an implicit return

const multiplyTwoNumbers = (num1, num2) => num1 * num2;

You can use map() method to add new HTML
map() iterates through an array and returns a new array

e.g. ```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((number) => number * 2); // doubledNumbers will be [2, 4, 6]
```

map takes a function as an argument, a callback function (which is a function passed as an arugment)

You may not want your array to print separated by commas, where we would need to print  a list instead. Join method can concatenate all elements to a single string

Optional chaining (?.) helps prevent errors accessing nested properties

e.g.```
const user = {
  name: "Quincy",
  address: {
    city: "San Francisco",
    state: "CA",
    country: "USA",
  },
};

// Accessing nested properties without optional chaining
const state = user.address.state; // CA

// Accessing a non-existent nested property with optional chaining
const zipCode = user.address?.zipCode; // Returns undefined instead of throwing an error

```

To use sort() method of arrrays, need to provide callback function

  userData?.songs.sort((a,b) => {callback function in here});


Strings are compared lexicographically whic means Apples is less than Bananas because A comes before B

Sort expects a number to be returned, negatives mean sort first item before second

Find() retrieves first element in an array that meets conditions specified in callback function, else returns undefined

audio.play() is the methdod from web audio api to play mp3

can add onclick as a property in html to call js function

indexOf() returns first index element can found at in array or -1

forEach() methods are used to iterate through an array and perform a function on each element

removeAttribute() will remove attribute for each

textContent lets you set text of a node and either set or retrieve text of HTML element

To give a random negative or postitive number for shuffling,
use Math.random() -0.5;

filter() method keeps only elements of an array that satisfy callback function

createElement() is a DOM method to dynamically make elements using JS. tag name is as a string

to assign element text, use createTextNode()

to set id and aria-label, javascript just has dot accessers

appendChild() method adds elements as child

"ended" is an event listener type
