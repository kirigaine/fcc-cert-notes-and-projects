const currentDate = new Date();

day = .getDate() [1-31]
month = .getMonth() [0-11]
year = .getFullYear()
hour = .getHours() [0-23]
minute = .getMinutes() [0-59]

switch statement in JS - commonly used for branching logic


switch (variable) {
	case 1:
	blah;
	break;
	case2:
	blah;
	break;
	default:
	blah;
}


to format our date into yyyy-mm-dd, we can use the split, reverse and join method
